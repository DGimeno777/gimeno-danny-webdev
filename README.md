# Danny Gimeno Personal Page and Web Dev Project

Hi! My name is Danny Gimeno. I'm Computer Science Major at Northeastern University in the class of 2020. This is the repo for my personal webpage, assignments, and final project made in CS4550. 

In this website you can find info on my interests, the organizations I'm part of, and projects I've worked on.

## WebDev Project

My semester project for webdev is a music research platform for general researchers, promoters, and agents. It will allow them to see popularity data (e.g. facebook likes) for musical artists and follow artists they are interested in or work with. You can go to it by clicking the 'Web Dev Final Project' of my homepage.

### Design
Below is the UML design of my project:
